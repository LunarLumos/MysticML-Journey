# Multiple Linear Regression

## Overview

Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) is a statistical method used to model the relationship between two or more features (independent variables) and a continuous target variable (dependent variable). It extends simple linear regression by allowing multiple input variables, enabling us to predict the value of a target variable based on several predictors.

### Formula for Multiple Linear Regression:

The general form of the equation for multiple linear regression is:

\[
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \dots + \beta_n X_n + \epsilon
\]

Where:
- \(Y\) is the dependent variable (target).
- \(\beta_0\) is the intercept (the value of \(Y\) when all \(X_i = 0\)).
- \(\beta_1, \beta_2, \dots, \beta_n\) are the coefficients (slopes) of the features \(X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n\).
- \(X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n\) are the independent variables (predictors).
- \(\epsilon\) is the error term (random noise).

## Use Cases of Multiple Linear Regression

Multiple Linear Regression can be applied in a variety of fields where predicting a continuous outcome based on multiple variables is necessary. Some common use cases include:

1. **Real Estate**: Predicting house prices based on factors like area, number of bedrooms, age of the house, etc.
2. **Finance**: Forecasting stock prices based on various economic indicators.
3. **Healthcare**: Predicting a patient's recovery time based on different medical factors (e.g., age, health status, treatment type).
4. **Marketing**: Estimating sales based on advertising budget, product price, and customer demographics.

## Mathematical Example for a Small Dataset

### Dataset:
Let's consider a small dataset for predicting house prices based on three factors: **Area (in sq. ft.)**, **Number of Bedrooms**, and **Age of the House (in years)**.

| Area (sq. ft.) | Bedrooms | Age (years) | Price (USD) |
|----------------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| 1500           | 3        | 10          | 350,000     |
| 1800           | 4        | 5           | 420,000     |
| 2400           | 3        | 15          | 460,000     |
| 3000           | 5        | 20          | 580,000     |
| 2200           | 4        | 8           | 500,000     |

In this example, the target variable is the **Price**, and the features are **Area**, **Bedrooms**, and **Age**.

### Model Equation:

For this dataset, we will fit a Multiple Linear Regression model. After training the model, the equation for predicting house prices will look like this:

\[
Price = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times Area + \beta_2 \times Bedrooms + \beta_3 \times Age
\]

Where:
- \(\beta_0\) is the intercept,
- \(\beta_1\), \(\beta_2\), and \(\beta_3\) are the coefficients (slopes) for **Area**, **Bedrooms**, and **Age**, respectively.

### Mathematical Example:

Assume after training the model, we get the following coefficients:

\[
\beta_0 = 200,000, \, \beta_1 = 100, \, \beta_2 = -20,000, \, \beta_3 = -15,000
\]

Now, for a house with the following features:
- **Area = 2000 sq. ft.**
- **Bedrooms = 4**
- **Age = 10 years**

The predicted price would be:

\[
Price = 200,000 + (100 \times 2000) + (-20,000 \times 4) + (-15,000 \times 10)
\]

\[
Price = 200,000 + 200,000 - 80,000 - 150,000
\]

\[
Price = 170,000
\]

So, the model predicts the price of this house to be **$170,000**.

## Model Evaluation

To assess the performance of the model, we use metrics such as:

- **R-squared**: It measures how well the model explains the variance in the target variable. R-squared values closer to 1 indicate a better fit.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: The average of the absolute errors. Lower values indicate better model performance.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: The average of the squared errors. Smaller values indicate a more accurate model.
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: The square root of MSE, which is in the same units as the target variable.

## Requirements

Before running the code, ensure you have the necessary Python packages installed. You can install them via pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multiple-linear-regression.git
